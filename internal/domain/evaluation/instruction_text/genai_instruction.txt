Please rate each on a 10-point scale, and rate the total score as a number out of 100.
Please also give us any advice or comments on the code to further improve it.
Please note that the code should not be used to give advice, etc.
Also, this will be output to the terminal, so ,to make it a little easier to read, please use pictograms.
For ease of viewing, please leave a space between each item in the evaluation.
